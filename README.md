# Memory Management App
This is a simple Memory Management Application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to create, view, edit, delete, and search memories. It also includes functionality for sorting memories and pagination for easier navigation. The app uses Axios for making HTTP requests to a backend server (assumed to be running locally) for memory management and includes several custom components for modular and reusable code.

## Features
* üìù Add new memories with titles and descriptions.
* üõ†Ô∏è Edit and delete existing memories.
* üîç Search memories by title or description.
* üïì Sort memories by date (newest to oldest or oldest to newest).
* ‚ù§Ô∏è Like memories.
* üìÑ Pagination to navigate through memories.
* ‚ú® Animated skeleton loaders for memories while data is being fetched.
